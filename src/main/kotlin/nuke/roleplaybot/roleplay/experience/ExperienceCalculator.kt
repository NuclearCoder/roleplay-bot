    Experience gained by message has a cap set by the maxGain constant.
    XP is calculated with several components, each weighted by their respective constants:

    - length: weighs 70% in the final gain
        Length XP follows inverse exponential growth, see the corresponding JavaDoc for more information.
        The constant lengthHalfLength is the word count for half the maximum gain.
        The current value for that constant is decided from the average number of words in a "wall" of text.
        Inverse exponential growth means the gain will increase more slowly as it reaches that average length.

    - typography: weighs 30% in the final gain
        TBD
